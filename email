Hi,
Please find below my responses and request to mail back scanned copy of my relieving letter as I won’t be able to come personally to collect it.
(a)  Submit your timesheet for Nov 2017 in field glass.  - Submitted
(b)  Client clearance Email for handover of logistics. (access card, laptop and other bank related accessories are to be returned to the bank ASAP to obtain clearance)- I have handed over to Utham. I’m unable to take print out as well as write email externally so I’m unable to obtain email clearance.
(c)  Return your Insurance/ EP cards at Helius office – I have sent to you via registered post on 15 Nov 2016. Please find tracking number for registered article sent through sing post (RC248517179SG) 
Upon submission of above we will file IR21 for your tax returns and will update you once the tax amount has be determined by IRAS. 
Thanks,
Umesh
